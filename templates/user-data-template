#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# On first boot, set the (default) ubuntu user's password to "ubuntu" and
# expire user passwords
#chpasswd:
#  expire: false
#  list:
#  - ubuntu:ubuntu


## On first boot, use ssh-import-id to give the specific users SSH access to
## the default user
#ssh_import_id:
#- lp:my_launchpad_username
#- gh:my_github_username

## Update apt database and upgrade packages on first boot
package_update: false
package_upgrade: false

## Install additional packages on first boot
#packages:
#- pwgen
#- pastebinit
#- [libpython2.7, 2.7.3-0ubuntu3.1]
